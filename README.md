<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


Drop the componenet on a lighthing page layout.
Enter Header and Sub Header
Enter in the API of the child object from which the records will be displayed
Enter int he API of the field on the child object that contains the ID of the parent record
![image](https://github.com/effordDev/sf-radical-related-list/assets/129213219/c77d6f95-93f2-445a-bb5a-6553da92e431)

Enter in the fields that you want to display, these become the headers.  You must enter the API of the fields seperated by a comma, in the order you want them to display.
Enter and filter as in a where clause you may want to filter the records by.  This would be good if you have 2 unique sets or record on the same related object. For example a set of scorring records for user 1, and a set for user 2, where you could include a field for User 1 and a field for user 2, then enter where User_Field='User 1' to show only those records.  This also alows for multiple users of a single related object and multiple uses of the Radical related list.

Enter any field you like to sort by and weather that's ASC (Ascending), of DESC (Desending)

then start defining the Object from which to pull the records:


### Prerequisites

- An active Salesforce org.
- A related list of records you want this component to display
- Useing SF lightning


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
